gama - my first HTML5 game
==========================

My first [Phaser](http://www.photonstorm.com/phaser)-based game. **Gama** is its name due to a distinct lack of imagination.

(obligatory **HTML5** buzz-word!!)

## Quick Installation
If you have node and grunt inslatted you can make use of the connect
package to get going straight away. Here's how on your terminal:

```
git clone git@github.com:OdinsHat/gama.git
cd gama
npm install
grunt connect
```

## How to Play
Its really simple:
* Collect the stars to increase your score.
* If you touch that nice green ball it creates more stars.
* BUT if you hit the ball too many times it turns evil (red) and starts eating stars.
* When it eats stars your score goes down.
* There is no _winning_ yet - or is there? Maybe there is - maybe its something deep and....no its just got no end.

_I expect it to grow into a AAA title within a monthâ¸®_

Check out my SECOND game (currently in development) called "[Drac](https://github.com/OdinsHat/drac)". A fantasy/horror platformer.
